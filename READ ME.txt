# Spotify API Setup

To use the Spotify integration, follow these steps:

1. Go to: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Log in with a Spotify account
3. Create a new app and copy the:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
4. Open the file: `appsettings.json`
5. Replace:
   - `"ClientId": "YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID"`
   - `"ClientSecret": "YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET"`

This is required for the app to seed artists, albums, and songs using the Spotify API.
